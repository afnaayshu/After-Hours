         The Department shall form an Internal Evaluation Committee (IEC) for the seminar
        with academic coordinator for that program as the Chairperson/Chairman and seminar
        coordinator & seminar guide as members. During &emsp; the seminar presentation of a
        student, all members of IEC shall be present. <br>
         Formation of IEC and guide allotment shall be completed within a week after the
        University examination (or last working day) of the previous semester. <br>
         Guide shall provide required input to their students regarding the selection of topic/
        paper. <br>
         Choosing a seminar topic: The topic for a UG seminar should be current and broad
        based rather than a very specific research work. It's advisable to choose a topic for the
        Seminar to be closely linked to the final year project &emsp; area. Every member of the project
        team could choose or be assigned Seminar topics that covers various aspects linked to
        the Project area. <br>
         A topic/paper relevant to the discipline shall be selected by the student during the
        semester break. <br>
         Topic/Paper shall be finalized in the first week of the semester and shall be submitted
        to the IEC. <br>
         The IEC shall approve the selected topic/paper by the second week of the semester. <br>
         Accurate references from genuine peer reviewed published material to be given in the
        report and to be verified
